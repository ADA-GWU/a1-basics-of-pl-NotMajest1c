When we check the memory size of Python objects using the __sizeof__() method, we may get different results depending on the system or Python version. I decided to test on an online Interpreter of Programiz and on my local machine. The same tuple (1, 2, 3) has a size of 48 bytes on both the online interpreter and my personal computer. This is because tuples are fixed-size containers and store only references to their elements. 

On the other hand, lists are dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink during program execution. To allow this flexibility, Python over-allocates memory for lists so that when new elements are added with methods like .append(), the underlying array does not need to expand immediately. This pre-allocation reduces the frequency of costly memory reallocations, making list operations faster on average. The exact amount the program will pre-allocate, depends on the Python version and system. For example in my case, the online interpreters output was: 48 72, and my local pc gave me 48 102 as the output. From the outputs we can deduce that, a list with three elements may use 72 bytes on one system, 104 bytes on another and some other number on an another system. These differences are specific to CPython, the standard Python interpreter written in C, and other Python implementations may show different results. In conclusion, tuples have fixed memory sizes, while lists sizes can vary because of their dynamic nature.
