In the Python version, (matrixSlicing.py) the program asks the user to input the number of rows and columns for the matrix. Then it generates a matrix filled with random integers between 0 and 10 (inclusive) using NumPy. The user inputs start and end indices for both rows and columns to slice the submatrix. If the end index is smaller than the start index, the program swaps the values to ensure a valid slice. Finally, it prints the sliced submatrix, and displays it using matplotlib pyplot.

In the C version, (matrixSlicing.c) I decided to implement all the logic directly in the main function without separate helper functions. The program dynamically allocates memory for the 2D matrix, fills it with random integers, and prints it. Then it takes the slice ranges from the user and swaps them if necessary to handle invalid input. Finally, it prints the sliced submatrix and frees the allocated memory.
