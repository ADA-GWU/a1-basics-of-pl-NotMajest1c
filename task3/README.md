The matrixMultiplication.py is my code, then I sent it to chatgpt and asked to enhance it, gptCodeMatrixMultiplication.py is that


Basically what I do in matrixMultiplication.py is that I take 4 integer inputs from the user, for the rows and columns of the matrixes to be multiplied, then I check if the given inputs are suitable for matrix multiplication. If so, i generate 2 matrixes of random values with the given sizes, save the current time to a variable, multiply the matrixes and take the end time to see the difference. And at the end there is a small unit test to check whether the fuction works correctly or not 


and the C version:
The core logic is the same, for the implementation used functions are:
createMatrix → Allocates memory for a 2D matrix of input size.

freeMatrix → Frees the memory of the 2D matrix.

fillMatrixRandom → Fills the matrix with random integers in a given range.

multiplyMatrices → Performs the matrix multiplication.

printMatrix → Prints the matrix to the console.

| Language | Execution Time (seconds) |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| C        | 0.00000300               |
| Python   | 0.00001216               |

Code size: The C implementation is much longer than Python because it requires manual memory allocation, indexing functions, and freeing of matrices. 
On the other hand, Python (NumPy) handles these internally.
